    <h1>intro</h1>
    <p>This year for my miniterm project I worked on developing and building an Arduino based controller
      for a WS2812B addressable RGB LED strip.  This would allow me to use the LED strip to carry out
      a variety of tasks, such as displaying a rainbow wave, pulsing various colors, as a visualizer for
      music, and many more!</p>

    <p>The materials I used included:</p>

      <li>MicroUSB FemaleBreakout Board</li>

      <li>MicroUSB Male Plug</li>
      <li>10μF Electrolytic Capacitor</li>
      <li>560Ω Resistor</li>
      <li>Lots of wire</li>

    <p>Before I began this project, I had not had much experience using the Arduino board or the software,
      so I first started off by putting the name of the Pro Micro into almighty google.  Google returned
      a list of several very helpful sources, including one by Adafruit covering the usage and pinout of the
      Pro Micro controller, seen below.</p>
    <img src="/miniterm_18/images/pinout.png" alt="pinout of the controller"/>
    <p>There are multiple versions of the Pro Micro that have been released - a 3.3V/8MHz one, and a
      5V/16MHz version.  If you can, be sure to pick up the 5V/16MHz version, which is the one that I am
      using, as it will allow you to output more power through the VCC pin.  For my project, the only pins
      that are used are VCC, GND, and pin 4.  VCC and GND are used to provide power to the WS2812B strip,
      whereas pin 4 is used to output the data that is used to control the colors of the strip.

    <p>After setting out to complete the program and assemble the circuit, I was able to squeeze all the
      components into a
